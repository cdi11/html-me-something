                    <p>A few years ago my wife and I took our kids to Disney World for a family vacation.  
                    While there we decided it would be fun to take a vacation to Disney World <span id="excite">without the 
                    kids, </span> and do what we wanted to do.  In the summer of 2017 we went for it.</p>

                    <h3>How are we going to do this?</h3>

                    <p>We actually decieded we were going to go in the summer of 2016.  There were lots of things to decide
                    before we could leave.  Where would we stay, how would we get there, and where would our kids go when
                    we were gone?  Lucky for me we have a year to plan this thing and I have a wife that loves to plan vacations.</p>

                    <h3>We had a year to plan and my wife was not going to waste any time.</h3> 
                    <p>My wife downloaded the <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/plan/my-disney-experience/?CMP=KNC-FY17_WDW_TRA_DOM_WDWResortOffers_MDX-MOD|BR|G|4171070.RR.AM.01.03|&keyword_id=aud-301716124492:kwd-81612744808|dc|my%20%2Bdisney%20experience%20app|165970637160|b|5060:3|&s_kwcid=AL!5060!3!165970637160!b!!!!my%20%2Bdisney%20experience%20app&ef_id=C9ZQBDmmhnoAAAcC:20170914011002:s">Disney App</a> 
                    a yearbefore we were going to go.  We started checking wait times on the 
                    app so we could figure out what fast passes we wanted to get.  We also looked into great places to eat and 
                    there is a fun game we learned about called <a href="http://www.wdwinfo.com/a-guide-to-drinking-around-epcots-world-showcase-at-walt-disney-world.htm">Drinking Around the World</a> that you can play at The Epcot Center.

                    <p>After the first day we quickly realized The Epcot Center is really fun without kids.  We got to walk around the
                        shops and talk to people.  When we were visiting Italy there was a woman making paper mache masks.  I watched her
                        make them talked to her about different techniques she used and how the artists formed different shapes on the masks.
                        After an hour of watching her make masks and asking quesitons I realized I hadn't asked anyone to "stop touching things.&quot

                    <h3 class="over">By the end we were ready to come home.</h3>
                    <p class ="over">It was a great trip.  We were glad to have the time away.  However after two weeks away we were
                        ready to be back with our kids.  If you ever get a chance to go to Disney World without kids you
                        should take it.
